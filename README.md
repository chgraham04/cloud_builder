# README

## Overview

- Build a cloud throughout 3 rounds (3 levels of the troposphere) of
drawing. Use Lifelines wisely, since you are only allotted three. You may use any
number of remaining Lifelines you have after each round.
- A Lifeline is a re-draw of 1 card from a deck of your choosing.

## General Play

- Cards you draw will have a text explaining the process, as well as either Cloud Strength points or
Resistance points. These points may affect you differently between different rounds.
- **To continue at the end of each round, and eventually win the game:**
  - If your Cloud Strength is greater than Resistance, you continue
  - If your Cloud Strength is equal to Resistance, you must either use a Lifeline until your
    Cloud Strength is greater, or start the next round at +1 Resistance (Not available in R3,
    you must have greater Cloud Strength to win)
  - If your Cloud Strength less than Resistance, you must use a Lifeline until your Cloud
    Strength is greater than or equal to your Resistance, then see the options above.

## Drawing
- In Level 1, you will draw 1 card from each deck. In Level 2, you will not draw a Nucleus, and in Level
  3, you will not draw a Nucleus or a Moisture card.
