## Overview
- Build a cloud throughout 3 rounds (3 levels of the troposphere) of
drawing. Use Lifelines wisely, since you are only allotted three. You may use any
number of remaining Lifelines you have after each round.
- A Lifeline is a re-draw of 1 card from a deck of your choosing.

## General Play
- Cards you draw will have a text explaining the process, as well as either Cloud Strength points or
Resistance points. These points may affect you differently between different rounds.
